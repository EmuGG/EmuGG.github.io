**Lesson 11**

This was our last lesson of the winter term, we were told we were going to have a half fun lesson and a half IT related lesson. These were put together so for the whole lesson we did an hour of code, I played a game where there were multiple levels that I had to add in certain bits of code to make it work. My biggest mistake was on one level where it asked me to spawn in some cows, I spawned in 10 then 20 then 50 then 100 then 200 but by 500 it stopped working. I closed the browser twice and eventually it had restarted that level for me so I completed it and moved on. After that I got stuck once when I had written the wrong name for a robot. By the end of the lesson I was two levels of completing it the hour of code.
