**Lesson 7**

This lesson we were given a code on Google Classroom in binary that we were told to decode into normal. For this I had to make a whole new part of code, for this I did everything the same (which was a surprise for me) except for where I separated the binary into 8's I did "right(...,8)", this 8 took the last 8 of each section so that I just had each digit in individual boxes. I then decoded that into decimal using Bin2Dec and then from that I used the data to transfer it from decimal to English. However I used Index and Match commands which couldnâ€™t differentiate the difference between uppercase and lowercase. So far everything works apart from that. The end result just on the coder (not the decoder) comes out slightly wrong because of that causing all letter to come out capital (like caps lock).
