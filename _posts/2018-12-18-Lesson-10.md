**Lesson 10**

This lesson we started looking at Python, we looked at basic commands such as print and if. We also looked at the while command to create a loop until the user inputted a name that is hopefully real the program scans for more than one space and character that aren't letters to determine if the "name" inputted might be an actual name for example B O B isn’t a name and neither is 1234hi etc. We used 'isalpha’ to command the computer to find out if the input contains anything not in the alphabet. Overall, the program asks you your name, then finds out if your name has too many spaces or any non-letters. Then if it does have either of those it tells you that it’s not a name and asks you again. Otherwise, it says Hello, ‘name’ and then says finish.
