**Lesson 4**

This is our last lesson of the half term, we didn't have many lessons because we missed a lot due to activities like enrichment day. However, I managed to get a lot done. This lesson I finished my data table and added everything like a coder a de-coder, multiple shifts in a handy box, being able to write the message in one cell rather than awkwardly typing over multiple, colour coding boxes to make it easier to find what you need and a unique password feature. At the end of the lesson we handed our spreadsheets in via Google Classroom.
