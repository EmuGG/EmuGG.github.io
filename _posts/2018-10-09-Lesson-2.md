**Lesson 2**

We missed a lesson due to enrichment day so these are our lessons afterwards. We have now learnt how to make the spaces appear empty rather than saying ERROR. This lesson I also added a passcode that you have to type in before the message actually appearing using an 'if' statement. If the correct password is not put in then it comes up with FALSE and doesnâ€™t display the coded message. We also found out how to decode the message using a different set of data however I did not get on to that as I was making my password work instead.
