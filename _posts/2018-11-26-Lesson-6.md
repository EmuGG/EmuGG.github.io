**Lesson 6**

Everyone came in and just started working on our Coders. I managed to get it very nearly working with some challenges along the way. By the end everything was fine and my coder was up and running with some adjustments needed to be made to the formatting to make it more user friendly but apart from that everything was looking good with my Binary coder, now I just have to make my decoder. This looks like it will be harder to make since I will have to split it into 8 and then manage to flip it back somehow. See the next blog on how I did it.
