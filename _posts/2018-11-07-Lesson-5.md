**Lesson 5**

This was our first lesson back after half-term we started by looking at basic binary like numbers and how it works and how using 8 bit binary you have 256 different combinations of on's and off’s meaning you can create the keyboard. This has already been made, so on Google Sheets what we have been tasked to do is make a coder and possibly a de-coder but instead of using a shift we have to use binary, we can get the data set online though making it much easier instead of writing out the alphabet 26 times. I managed to find a suitable data set and have started work on the coder, however, I didn’t manage to finish too much because a lot of the lesson was spent understanding binary and what we were doing.
