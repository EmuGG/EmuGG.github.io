**Lesson 3**

This we looked at a much bigger set of data so that we could make choose how much to shift with the same set of data therefore making a different codes and making it harder to crack. As a class we also figured out how to decode the message as well by finding out the pattern with what the letter turns into. We then used only the message and the shift to decode it using the same data set. I managed to create this set of data but as a class we didn't have much time to do much more on our own google sheets.
