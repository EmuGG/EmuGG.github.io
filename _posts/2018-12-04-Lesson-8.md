**Lesson 8**

We are now â…” through the term so we have switched teacher and classroom, now we are with Mr. Keen and are doing Python. This lesson we looked at making instructions for "aliens" that didn't know anything. For example, we had to make and instructions list on how to make tea; fetch the kettle, put water in the kettle, boil the kettle etc. We then all went to the front of the class and each group took turns to say the next step in the instructions for making tea. This went all wrong and ended up with you leaving for 5 minutes without returning and then pouring milk on the floor. It is important to learn this because computers do exactly what you tell them to do and can't improvise with what might seem like something you do naturally.
