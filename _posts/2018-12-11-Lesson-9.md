**Lesson 9**

This lesson we all came up to the front to learn about numbers and about how computers count in binary. We looked at binary and base 10 then we looked at decimal and converting it to binary. Then we looked at hexadecimal and how to convert that to base 10. Hexadecimal is made with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f so it is basically base 16. Binary works with just 0's and 1’s so 0 = 0, 1 = 1, 10 = 2, 11 = 3, 100 = 4, 101 = 5 and so on. Nowadays computers use 32 bit and 64 bit that means a computer can store 32 or 64 digits in binary. To calculate this is 'easy’ you just do 2 to the power of 63 for example or 2^31. 2^31 = 4,294,967,295 so that is how many values it can store, this is how Gangnam Style broke youtube, by exceeding a certain amount of views that youtube couldn’t handle.
