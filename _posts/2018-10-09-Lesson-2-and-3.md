**Lesson 2 and 3**

We missed a lesson due to enrichment day so these are our lessons afterwards. We have now learnt how to make the spaces appear empty rather than saying ERROR. This lesson I also added a passcode that you have to type in before the message actually appearing using an 'if' statement. If the correct password is not put in then it comes up with FALSE and doesnâ€™t display the coded message. We also found out how to decode the message using a different set of data however I did not get on to that as I was making my password work instead.

In our next lesson we looked at a much bigger set of data so that we could make choose how much to shift with the same set of data therefore making a different codes and making it harder to crack. As a class we also figured out how to decode the message as well by finding out the pattern with what the letter turns into. We then used only the message and the shift to decode it using the same data set. I managed to create this set of data but as a class we didn't have much time to do much more on our own google sheets.
