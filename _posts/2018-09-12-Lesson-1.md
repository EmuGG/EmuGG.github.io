**Year 9 - Started Using Google Sheets**

**Summary:**

This lesson was our first ICT lesson of the year, we started by looking at the Caesar shift code and made an electronic replica using google sheets. We learnt and used vlookup to find a letter in one cell and print out another letter on a cell under it, we could also use hlookup to find a cell to the right of it. Vlookup means vertical lookup and hlookup means horizontal lookup, using this if we wrote the alphabet normally next to the alphabet shifted 4 letters forward we could make a caesar code.
